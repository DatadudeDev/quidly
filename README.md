# Quidly


**Quidly** was a prototype mobile app designed to explore **transparent direct democracy** through **peer-to-peer (P2P) polling** and **blockchain-based vote verification**.

Built in Flutter, Quidly served as a proof-of-concept for decentralized decision-making — giving users the power to propose, debate, and vote on topics directly without centralized intermediaries.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Quidly is a deprecated research project. It is no longer actively maintained.

## 📱 App Overview

- **P2P Polling:** Users could create and participate in polls without centralized servers.
- **Blockchain Verification:** Poll results were immutably recorded and verified using blockchain technology.
- **Social Voting Feed:** A real-time feed allowed users to browse, propose, and engage with active polls.
- **Focus on Digital Democracy:** The goal was to simulate how grassroots governance could function digitally at local, regional, and national levels.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** — Cross-platform app development
- **Dart** — Primary programming language
- **IPFS / Blockchain Integration** — For decentralized poll storage and verification
- **Firebase** (early version) — Used temporarily for prototype messaging

## 🌎 Why Quidly?

The project aimed to test key ideas around **direct digital governance**:
- Can voting and debate happen without a central authority?
- Can cryptographic verification build public trust in the process?
- Can local issues and national decisions be handled transparently via mobile apps?

Quidly was an early step toward answering these questions.
